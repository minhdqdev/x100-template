## 2. Vision & Purpose
_What are we building and why does it matter?_  
An IoT anomaly detection system that monitors 100,000+ industrial sensors in real-time to identify unusual patterns and alert operators before equipment failures occur.

---

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics
- **Goal 1**: Support 100,000 sensors with real-time data processing â€” *<1 second latency for anomaly detection*
- **Goal 2**: Reduce equipment downtime through early anomaly detection â€” *20% reduction in unplanned maintenance*
- **Goal 3**: Provide comprehensive monitoring dashboard â€” *100% sensor visibility and alert management*

---

## 4. Scope
**In-Scope**: 
- Real-time data ingestion from 100,000 IoT sensors (1-minute intervals)
- Anomaly detection algorithms for time-series data
- Multi-channel alerting system (email, SMS, web notifications)
- Web dashboard for device management and monitoring
- TimescaleDB integration for time-series data storage
- Redis caching layer for performance optimization

**Out-of-Scope**: 
- Sensor hardware provisioning
- Advanced ML model training (Phase 2)
- Mobile applications
- Integration with third-party maintenance systems

---

## 5. Key Deliverables
- **Backend API**: Python/Django service with Kafka message processing
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Next.js/React web application with real-time monitoring
- **Data Pipeline**: TimescaleDB + Redis infrastructure for time-series data
- **Alert System**: Multi-channel notification service with Celery task processing
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized application stack

## 7. Risks & Assumptions
- **Risk 1**: High data volume may cause performance bottlenecks â€” *Implement horizontal scaling with Kafka partitioning*
- **Risk 2**: False positive alerts may cause alert fatigue â€” *Implement tunable threshold settings*
- **Risk 3**: TimescaleDB scaling limitations â€” *Plan for database sharding strategy*
- **Key Assumptions**: 
  - Sensors provide consistent data format
  - Network connectivity is reliable for real-time processing
  - SOA architecture can handle the required throughput
