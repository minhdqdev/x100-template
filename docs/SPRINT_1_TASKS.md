## 🚨 Sprint Risks & Dependencies

### High Risk Items
- TimescaleDB configuration complexity may impact timeline
- MQTT integration testing requires physical/simulated IoT devices
- Authentication security implementation needs thorough review

### Dependencies
- Docker environment must be stable before backend development
- Database schema must be finalized before data ingestion testing
- User roles definition affects all subsequent UI development

### Mitigation Strategies
- Prepare Docker environment setup scripts early in sprint
- Use MQTT simulators for testing if physical devices unavailable
- Schedule security review session mid-sprint for authentication system
