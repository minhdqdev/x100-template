## 7. Risks & Assumptions

**Technical Risks**:
- **TimescaleDB Performance** - High-volume sensor data may impact query performance (Mitigation: Early load testing and optimization)
- **ML Model Accuracy** - False positives may cause alert fatigue (Mitigation: Iterative model tuning and threshold optimization)
- **Real-time Processing** - System may not meet <1 second latency requirements (Mitigation: Stream processing optimization and caching)

**Business Risks**:
- **User Adoption** - Operators may resist changing existing monitoring workflows (Mitigation: User training and change management)
- **Data Quality** - Poor sensor data quality may impact detection accuracy (Mitigation: Robust data validation and cleaning)

**Key Assumptions**:
- IoT sensors can be configured to send data via MQTT/HTTP protocols
- Industrial environment has stable network connectivity
- Users have basic technical knowledge for system configuration
- Historical normal operation data is available for ML model training
