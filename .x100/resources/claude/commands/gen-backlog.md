description: Generate project backlog
---

- Use `project-owner` subagent to generate product backlog
- Use `.x100/doc-templates/PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` as the template and store the final backlog to `docs/PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md`

- After having the backlog, write a recommended sprint planning to `docs/SPRINT_PLANNING.md`

- Only overwrite existing docs if $ARGUMENTS is "force"

References:
- `docs/PRD.md`
