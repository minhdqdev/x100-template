description: Generate product requirements document from refined idea
---

- From `docs/REFINED_IDEA.md`, write a product requirements document and save it to `docs/PRD.md`
- Use `doc-templates/LEAN_PRD.md` as template.
- If `docs/REFINED_IDEA.md` does not exist, run `/refine-idea` first to generate it
