description: Generate user stories from product backlog
---

- If `docs/PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` does not exist, stop and inform the user to run `/gen-product-backlog` first.
- Read `.x100/references/USER_STORY.md` for best practices on writing user stories.
- Read `.x100/references/TECHNICAL_GUIDELINES.md` for technical guidelines.
- From epics defined in `docs/PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md`, write user stories and save them to `docs/user-stories/US-<ID>.md`
- Use `.x100/doc-templates/USER_STORY.md` as template for each user story.
