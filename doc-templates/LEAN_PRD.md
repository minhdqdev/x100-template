## 1. Overview
**Context:**
<!-- Problem statement + opportunity. -->

**Proposed solution:**

## 2. Goals
Primary outcome (e.g., acquire first 1000 users, validate market demand).

Key success metric (one or two max).

## 3. Users
Target users / early adopters: Who exactly are they?

## 4. Scope
Must-have (MVP): Core features needed to test the idea.

Nice-to-have (Future): Things we’ll add if the MVP works.

Non-functional (constraints): e.g., “must work on mobile web,” “secure sign-in.”

## 6. Design & Experience

Quick sketches, wireframes, or link to Figma.

Keep focus on “happy path” flow (main journey users take).

Examples:

% of users completing onboarding

Daily active users

Conversion to paid

## 8. Risks & Assumptions
Assumptions we’re testing (e.g., “users will trust us with their data”).

Top risks + how we’ll learn/mitigate quickly.

## 9. Timeline
MVP target date: [rough date]

Next milestone: [e.g., first 100 users, investor demo]
