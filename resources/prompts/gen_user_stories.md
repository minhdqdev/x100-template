description: Use this prompt to generate user stories from product backlog
---

Read these files to understand the context before writing the user stories. Stop if one of the following files are missing:
- `docs/PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md`
- `.x100/resources/references/USER_STORY_GUIDELINE.md`

Use `.x100/resources/doc-templates/USER_STORY.md` as a template.

Generate user stories in `docs/user-stories/` if they do not already exist.

Suggest improvements for the user stories.
