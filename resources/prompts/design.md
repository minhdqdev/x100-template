description: Use this prompt to generate design artifacts
---

Stop if one of the following files are missing:
- `docs/PRD.md`
- `.x100/resources/references/TECHNICAL_GUIDELINE.md`
- `.x100/resources/references/SA_CHECKLIST.md`

Read those files and `.x100/resources/references/SA_CHECKLIST.md` to understand what design artifacts are needed.

Generate the design artifacts if they do not already exist.

Record this change to `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
