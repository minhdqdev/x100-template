description: Use this prompt to generate product backlog from PRD
---

Read these files to understand the project before writing the product backlog. Stop if one of the following files are missing:
- `docs/PRD.md`
- `.x100/resources/references/TECHNICAL_GUIDELINE.md`

Use `.x100/resources/doc-templates/PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` as a template.

Generate `docs/PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` if it does not already exist.

Record this change to `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

Suggest improvements for the product backlog.
