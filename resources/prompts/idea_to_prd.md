description: Use this prompt to generate PRD from idea
---

Stop if one of the following files are missing:
- `docs/IDEA.md`
- `.x100/resources/references/TECHNICAL_GUIDELINE.md`

Refine `docs/IDEA.md` using guideline from `.x100/resources/references/TECHNICAL_GUIDELINE.md` and use `.x100/resources/doc-templates/IDEA.md` as a template.

Read those files to understand the idea and technical guidelines before writing the PRD.

Use `.x100/resources/doc-templates/PRD.md` as a template.

Generate `docs/PRD.md` if it does not already exist.

Suggest improvements to the PRD.
